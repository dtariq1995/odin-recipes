    <p>Is this your dream too ? Well, If thatâ€™s the case, this is the recipe youâ€™ll want in your back pocket.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pkg regular oreos</li>
        <li>6 tbsp butter, melted</li>
        <li>8 oz cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>1 cup confectioners/powdered sugar</li>
        <li>16 oz cool whip</li>
        <li>1 5.9 oz pkg chocolate instant pudding</li>
        <li>2 3/4 cup milk, cold</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Crush the whole package of cookies either with a food processor, or place them in a large ziplock bag and crush them with a rolling pin. Save about 1 cup to sprinkle on top of dessert lasagna when it's done.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl mix remaining crumbs with melted butter. When the butter is distributed, transfer the mixture to a 9 x 13 inch baking dish, and press the crumbs into the bottom of the pan.</li>
        <li>Using electric mixer, mix half of Cool Whip, softened cream cheese, and confectioners sugar in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Spread the mixture on top of the oreo crust. Transfer to the refrigerator while you are making a pudding.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, combine chocolate instant pudding with cold milk. Whisk for several minutes until the pudding starts to thicken. Spread the pudding over the previous layer, and let it sit for 10 minutes to firm up the pudding.</li>
        <li>Spread the remaining half of cool whip over the pudding, and sprinkle with reserved Oreo crumbs on top.</li>
        <li>Refrigerate until ready to serve.</li>
    </ol>
